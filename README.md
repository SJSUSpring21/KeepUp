## 1. Toxicometer:
  Social media abuse, whether it's cyberbullying or posting toxic comments to provoke the masses, is increasingly making the social media space an unsafe place to interact, leading to various emotional problems among its users like depression, anxiety, mass hysteria, and so on. In an effort to prevent such social disruption, we propose to build a solution to moderate the textual content and determine the nature of the prose based on its toxicity. This will help the social media website/blog owners to automatically identify any toxic content posted on their platform thereby empowering them to make censorship decisions.
  
  We intend to implement its core functionality by making use of Natural Language Processing and Recurrent Neural Networks.


## 2. MusicMood:
  Everyone has their own taste in music which has led to its classification into various genres like rock, pop, jazz, and so on. Given the scale of new music content generated every day, it has posed certain challenges in cataloging it based on these genres as it requires a certain degree of human expertise, making the whole process expensive and tedious. We propose to build an automated solution to address this problem in a cost-effective manner. We'll basically leverage the existing content's classification metadata and correlate it with its audio spectrograms to build our own classification model to call out the given content's genre. Music streaming service providers can certainly benefit from this to form better recommendations for their subscribers and enhance their listening experience overall.
  
  We intend to use convolutional neural networks and the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to implement the proposed solution.
    
    
## 3. ImmiBot:
  Lately, there have been a lot of changes in US immigration rules owing to the pandemic situation. This has caused a lot of anxiety among the immigrants as most of them are struggling to find good immigration advice at a reasonable cost. That is why we propose to build a one-stop chatbot solution to provide free immigration advice in a user-friendly fashion. This AI-driven chatbot would have access to the immigration knowledge base and would intelligently pull relevant information to answer any of the immigration-related queries posted by the user. Users can seek guidance by having layman's conversations with the chatbot to know about the eligibility criteria for a specific visa, the impact on their current immigration status due to new policy revisions, and much more.
  
  We intend to use IBM Watson assistant to implement the above chatbot solution.
